# MPI Machine Learning Tutorial

I suggest cloning this git repository. To do so type `git clone https://github.com/raspstephan/MPI-ML-Tutorial.git`. Alternatively, you can download a zip file.

## Preparation

*Note: We are using Python 3.6!*

For the tutorial, we will use Jupyter notebooks. If you are familiar with Python and how to install libraries, simply open up the `demo.ipynb` notebook and make sure you can run all the cells without any errors.

If you are not so familiar with Python and Python packages, I highly recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) package manager. Simply go to the website and download the Anaconda version for your OS and follow the installation instructions. Then install the packages we will need for this tutorial:

```
conda install numpy matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn keras
```

Then go into this directory on your machine and type `jupyter notebook`. A window should appear in your browser. From there click on the `demo.ipynb` notebook and try to execute all cells. To execute a cell simply click the `play` button or type `shift` + `Enter`.
